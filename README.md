# ðŸ“¹ai_video_editor
`Python` code for a package that serves two purposes:

1. Control system for the `expS` project.
2. Live video editor based on pose estimation/object detection models.

### Main characteristics:
> 1. Handles all communication between [expS_menu](https://github.com/alumiaCoder/expS_menu), [expS_video_server](https://github.com/alumiaCoder/expS_video_server) and [expS_fb_synth](https://github.com/alumiaCoder/expS_fb_synth).
> 2. Processes, edits and plays in real-time the video captured by [expS_video_server](https://github.com/alumiaCoder/expS_video_server).
> 3. Uses [yolov7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) based `object detection` and `pose estimation` to create human aware editing functions.
